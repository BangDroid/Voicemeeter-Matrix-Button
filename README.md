**If any of the above are missing, this will not function**


# Use
Once you have installed VoiceMeeter Banana and AutoHotKey, download the 8 channel Gain Matrix from the above link. Place both **_vmr_matrix.exe_ & _button.png_** inside VoiceMeeter's install directory (default: C:\Program Files (x86)\VB\Voicemeeter).
With Voicemeeter Banana running, run **vmbutton.ahk** The new button should appear like in the above image.
For best results, add vmbutton.ahk to your Windows startup folder.

# Note

I will not be doing any support for either Voicemeeter or Autohotkey. Please use the relevant forums for that! I have tested this on only 2 machines and it works as expected, though I cannot confirm for every machine. If you have any issues related to this script, by all means I will try to help.
